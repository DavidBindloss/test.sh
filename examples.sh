# we expect echo foo to execute successfully

expect echo "foo"
# The same as above 0 is the expected exit code of any function

# contains by itself doesn\'t do anything
contains "foo" "f"
# But does set the exit code, here $? will be 0

# which means
contains "foo" "f"; expect $?
# will assert that the contains returns a 0 exit code

# Get funky expect 1 to not equal 0:
[ 1 -eq 0 ]; expect $([ $? -eq 1 ]) 0
